                        <li> Step 1: Set up your development environment
                        Before you start learning HTML, you'll need a place to write and test your code. There are a few options for this, but the most common is to use a text editor like Notepad++ or Sublime Text. You'll also need a web browser like Google Chrome or Firefox to preview your HTML code. </li> 
                        
                        <li><br></li>
                        
                        <li>Step 2: Learn the basic structure of an HTML page
                        An HTML page is made up of elements, which are defined by tags. The most basic structure of an HTML page looks like this: </li> 

                        <li><br></li>

                        <li><a href="blog eg1.txt">Example : 1</a></li> 

                        <li><br></li>
                        
                        <li>The < !DOCTYPE html > declaration tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document. The < html > element is the root element of the HTML page, and it contains the < head > and < body > elements. The < head > element contains information about the page, such as the title and any linked stylesheets or scripts. The < body > element contains the content that is displayed on the page.</li> 

                        <li><br></li>
                        
                        <li>Step 3: Learn the basic HTML tags
                        HTML tags are used to mark up the content of an HTML page. Some common tags include:
                        Here's an example of how these tags might be used: </li> 

                        <li><br></li>
                        
                        <li><a href="blog eg2.txt">Example : 2</a></li> 

                        <li><br></li>
                        
                        <li>Step 4: Practice and experiment
                        The best way to learn HTML is to practice and experiment with your own code. Start by creating a simple HTML page and adding some basic content. Then, try adding different tags and see how they affect the appearance and structure of the page. </li> 

                        <li><br></li>
